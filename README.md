# PHP-salary-payroll

## Assignment
You are required to create a utility in PHP to help us determine the dates we need to pay salaries to the sales department. 
We handle our sales payroll as follows:
- Sales staff get a regular monthly fixed base salary. The salary for a month is paid on the last  day of the month, unless that day is a weekend day (Saturday, Sunday). In that case, the  salary is paid on the Friday before said weekend. 
- Sales staff get a monthly bonus. On the 15th of every month the bonus is paid for the  previous month, unless that day is a weekend day (Saturday, Sunday). In that case, the bonus is paid on the first Wednesday after the 15th. 
- The application needs to be (at the least) able to output the results in a CSV file. The file  should contain the results for the whole year. The file should contain 3 columns: month, the  salary payment date for that month and the bonus payment date for the bonus of that month. â€¢ The user needs to be able to input the year they want to receive the dates for.
